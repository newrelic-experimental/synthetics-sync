# Synthetics Sync
Github action that will sync synthetic script commits to corresponding Synthetic monitors within New Relic.

Currently supports the following for Scripted Browser or Scripted API type monitors:
 - Syncing script changes to existing monitors.
 - Creating new monitors for new scripts committed.

## Requirements
1. Configure your [New Relic User key](https://docs.newrelic.com/docs/apis/intro-apis/new-relic-api-keys/#user-key) as a repository secret.
2. Create and configure your Workflow yaml ([see examples here](#examples)) under `.github/workflows`.

**IMPORTANT**
* This action also uses [tj-actions/changed-files](https://github.com/tj-actions/changed-files) to detect changes to any js files committed.
* Filenames of scripts committed should be 1-1 exact with the corresponding `monitorName` within New Relic.
* If you plan on creating **new monitors** from newly committed scripts, each script must have one of the following comments somewhere within, to denote the monitor type (scripted browser or scripted api):

```js
//monitorType: SCRIPT_BROWSER
```
OR
```js
//monitorType: SCRIPT_API
```

## Usage

```yaml
name: New Relic Synthetics

# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
# Event `push`: Compare the preceding commit -> to the current commit.
# -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
on: [push]

env:
  NEW_RELIC_API_KEY: ${{ secrets.NEW_RELIC_API_KEY }} #Required repository secret

jobs:
  sync_synthetic_monitors:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest

    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v3


      # Detects changes to .js files only in any sub path, formats those filenames/paths as json
      - name: Get Changed Scripts
        id: changed-files
        uses: tj-actions/changed-files@v35
        with:
          separator: ","
          files: |    # Modify this to wherever your specific scripts reside - defaults to any js files
            **/*.js
          json: "true"

      # Proceed with storing filenames/paths in a local file for further processing, ONLY if any .js files have changed or been committed.
      - name: Store Changed Scripts
        if: steps.changed-files.outputs.any_changed == 'true'
        run: |
          echo ${{ steps.changed-files.outputs.all_changed_files }} > monitors.json
          cat monitors.json

      # Parse out js filenames, which should match the entity names within NR, fetch the entity's guid, and update existing monitor or create new one
      - name: Sync Changes to Synthetics
        if: steps.changed-files.outputs.any_changed == 'true'
        uses: newrelic-experimental/synthetics-sync@v1.2
        with: # OPTIONAL defaults for creation of new scripts committed
          accountId: ""
          runtime: ""
          privateLocations: ""
          publicLocations: ""
          interval: ""
          status: ""
```

## Inputs
The following are optional inputs if you wish to automatically **create** new monitors from newly committed scripts. If these are not included in the workflow, only changes to existing scripts will be sync'd with New Relic.

## Examples
Below are a couple different configurations for various use cases:

<details>
<summary>Sync modified scripts only</summary>

```yaml
...

```yaml
...
  - name: Sync Changes to Synthetics
    if: steps.changed-files.outputs.any_changed == 'true'
    uses: newrelic-experimental/synthetics-sync@v1.2
    with: # all optional defaults for creation of new scripts committed
      accountId: 123
      runtime: "new"
      privateLocations: "[{'guid': 'xtz'},{'guid': 'abc'}]"
      publicLocations: "['AWS_AP_EAST_1', 'AWS_US_EAST_2']"
      interval: EVERY_30_MINUTES
